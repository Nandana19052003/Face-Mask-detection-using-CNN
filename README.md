# Face-Mask-detection-using-CNN
This project aims to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of 7,553 RGB images with 3 color channels (RGB), categorized into two folders: "with_mask" and "without_mask". The "with_mask" folder contains 3,725 images of faces wearing masks, while the "without_mask" folder contains 3,828 images of faces without masks.

# Model Architecture and Performance
A custom CNN architecture was designed and trained on the dataset for face mask detection. The model achieved a training accuracy of 94% and a validation accuracy of 96%

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of CNNs for face mask recognition. The model was trained on a dataset consisting of 7,553 images, achieving high accuracy on both the training and validation sets. The trained model can be further fine-tuned or used as a starting point for other face mask detection applications.
